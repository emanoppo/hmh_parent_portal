#parentPortal

Research in health, education, and child development has consistently shown that parent engagement in schools is linked to better academic performance, behavior, and social emotional skills. One way to encourage parent engagement is by providing transparency around student progress, and having clear channels of communication. Our app seeks to provide a way to facilitate communication between teachers and parents by providing a way to track and share information about student assignments/projects and a hub for conversation.
